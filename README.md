# Description

In this week's challenge I took a company's website and changed code to make it more organized and accessible, while maintaining it's layout and functionality. 

## Table of contents

```
*[URL](#URL)
*[Changes from Original Code made](#Changes from original code made)
```

## URL

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Changes from original code made

You are required to submit the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a professional README describing the project.
